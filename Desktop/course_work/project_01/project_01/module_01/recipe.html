        </h1>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Pour olive oil into the bottom of a large roasting pan.</li>
                <li>Roast in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until bones and vegetables are browned, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Transfer roasted chicken bones and vegetables to an 8-quart stockpot. Pour wine into the roasting pan, scraping the bottom to release any browned bits of food; pour into stockpot. Add peppercorns, cloves, bay leaves, and thyme to stockpot. Cover the mixture with water and bring to a slow simmer. Set heat to low and simmer, straining off fat as needed, for at least 5 hours. Strain stock through a cheesecloth; refrigerate or freeze stock.</li>
            </ol>
